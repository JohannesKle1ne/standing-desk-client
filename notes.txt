mosquitto -v -c test.conf

sudo poweroff

Learnings:
- Zugang zu Server ist nur mit key file auf PC zugänglich
- Datenbank und Server sollen auf uni Server laufen
- Broker läut auf Server und alle Tische verbinden sind dorthin
- Mein Tisch sendet nurup/down. Logik wird im keypad gemacht.


Todos:

- compare MQTT to Socket Connection (sind nachrichten verschlüsselt?)
- get motionsensor running with configuration (Distance, Accuracy)
- Think about status status LEDS 
- create Captive portal (with library)
- frontend: Look into "Dropbox like" application
 -> c# new NotifyIcon
 -> pystray could be platform independant


Learnings motionsensor:

sensitivity potentiometer: shortest distance (3 meter) when turned to 10:00 o'clock (7:00-10:00 no detection at all) -> the minimum distance of 3 meters is probalby to short!

delay potentiometer: if delay increased the sensor keeps up the detection signal a longer period. 
So the python library will find motion a lot of times after motion was detected.-> short delay seems to be more useful

Non-repeatable Trigger: After detecting motion and triggering the output high, the sensor will automatically switch to a low state after the delay time is over, 
regardless of any ongoing motion in its sensing range.

Repeatable Trigger: If there is continuous motion in the sensor's range, the output will remain high. 
The delay time will be extended automatically for each subsequent motion event, starting from the last event.


Next: Create a repository where you commit these notes and code!

Todos Donnerstag:
- find alternative motion sensor
- think about how a server monitor could look like
- build a dropbox like interface for elektron app

Findings:
- how about putting the sonsor to the floor so only feet movement is detected?
- there is an open source version of HiveMQ that can be run on a private server
- there is a very usul "reconnectPeriod: 1000" in node mqtt
