Introduction:
- introduce you to my master thesis topic that I just started to work on
- topic: Integrating an autonomous standing desk into the workplace

Problem:
- as most of you are aware of, most people sit a lot, especially during their work times
- Many studies show that spend a lot time sitting each day can lead to negative consequences for health
- A solution to reduceing the amount of sitting during the workday are height adjustable standing desks
- Wich those you can easy move you desk up and down depending on you wanting to stand or sit
- Those desks have shown to reduce the amount of sitting time and therefor reduce helath risks and discomfort for the user
- However, the problem here is that even when people want to stand more and got a standing desk for themself, they rarly use it in standing mode in practics
- This is exaclty what an autonmpous standing desk can imporve
- I want to implement a system that moves the users table in samrt way while giving the user full 
control over the configureation
- I want to conduct a study that tests this system in the daily life and on real Workplaces with participants that decided to use
a standing desk while working
- with my study I want to answer the followong research question:
RQ: How should an autonomous standing desk be designed, to support the user in reaching his/her standing goals?
oder
RQ: How should an autonomous standing desk be designed, to sublty assist users in reaching their desigred standing time?
