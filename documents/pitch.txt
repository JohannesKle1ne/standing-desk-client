Introduction:
- introduce you to my master thesis topic that I just started to work on
- topic: Integrating an autonomous standing desk into the workplace

Problem:
- as most of you are aware of, most people sit a lot, especially during their work times
- Many studies show that spend a lot time sitting each day can lead to negative consequences for health
- A solution to reduceing the amount of sitting during the workday are height adjustable standing desks
- Wich those you can easy move you desk up and down depending on you wanting to stand or sit
- Those desks have shown to reduce the amount of sitting time and therefor reduce helath risks and discomfort for the user
- However, the problem here is that even when people want to stand more and got a standing desk for themself, they rarly use it in standing mode in practics

Solution:
- This is exaclty what an autonmpous standing desk can imporve
- I want to implement a system that is able to move the users desk in autonomousy while still given to option to controll it manually
- I want to conduct a study that tests this system in the daily life and on real Workplaces with participants that decided to use
a standing desk while working
- with my study I want to answer the followong research question:
RQ: How should an autonomous standing desk be designed, to support the user in reaching the desired amount of standing time?

Implementation (Components):
- my system will build upon in existing project of Luke Haliburton and his Kollegues Kollegues (from this reseach group)
- desk controller (via ethernat cables it can be connected to the table and keypad)
- the desk controler is able to move the desk up or down or to a specific preset that was set by the user
- motion/presence sensor: can be used to detect if the user is curretnly sitting at the desk
- status leds on the controller to show the current state (conneced, not connected, showing if motion detected)
- Additionally we will have a dashbord at the users personal computer that is able to displays data from he table and 
can be used to configure the table moving behaviour

Design Goals:
-> non interupting movement:
- how should the tables behave?
- since the idea is to encourage the user to stand more the triavil approach would be to move up the desk at certain times each day
- However previous studiey show that users dislike beeing interuped in their curretn task by that
- So my goal is to find the right timing for table movement
- One promising apporach is to use a motion sensor at the table that can find time intervals where the users is not present at the desk
- This interval can then be used to move the desk up without intereuppting any user task
- Lukes previous study, which a similar approach, showed that users favored desk movent durening breaks
-> desk learns from user:
- the system should be able to understand bahvioural pattern of the user and adapt to it
- e.g. person likes to sit in the morning,but stand in the afternoon
-> easy to setup and configure
-> visualized statistics/feedback about theier amount of standing time

Study:
- try to recurte participants that are already decided to use a standing desk
- setup controller on their workplace
- in my study I plan to have a baseline study to gather insights about manual movemnt of the desk (at least one week)
- after that participant will install the system and use that for some weeks (between subjets or all have the same configureation)


open questions:
- study duration?
- study design (between subjets or same configureation)?
- type of motion/presence sensor using with pi zero?
- degree of freedom for personal configuration?
