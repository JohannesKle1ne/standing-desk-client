Introduction:
- introduce you to my master thesis topic that I just started to work on
- topic: Integrating an autonomous standing desk into the workplace

Problem:
- as most of you are aware of, most people sit a lot, especially during their work times
- Many studies show that spend a lot time sitting each day can lead to negative consequences for health
- A solution to reduceing the amount of sitting during the workday are height adjustable standing desks
- Wich those you can easy move you desk up and down depending on you wanting to stand or sit
- Those desks have shown to reduce the amount of sitting time and therefor reduce helath risks and discomfort for the user
- However, the problem here is that even when people want to stand more and got a standing desk for themself, they rarly use it in standing more in practics
