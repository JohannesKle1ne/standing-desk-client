-- Problem --

- sitting as health risk (negative consequences)
- solution ->  height-adjustable standing desks.
- move your desk up and down depending on whether you want to stand or sit
-> reduce health risks and discomfort for the person.
But: long term studies have shown that even when people own a standing desk, they rarely use it in practice.

-- Solution --

Autonomous standing desks are one potential solution -> they can increase the overall standing time.
-> planning to implement such a system that is able to move the user's desk autonomously and can decide for the user to move or up.
RQ: How should an autonomous standing desk be designed to support the user in reaching the desired amount of standing time?


-- Design Goals --

Non-interrupting movement:
- trivial approach, not perfect (interval mode)
- users dislike being interrupted
-> finding the right timing for desk movement
- study Luke Haliburton and colleagues showed that users favored desk movement during breaks -> presence detection extended in new implementation

Desk learns from the user:
- understand behavioral patterns of the user and adapt to them
- example: person likes to sit in the morning but stand in the afternoon

Intuitive setup and configuration
- to be installed at personal workplace (in the wild study)

user data visualization
- users can track their progress of standing time


-- Implementation --

- builds upon existing project of Luke Haliburton and colleagues
- Motion/presence sensor: can be used to detect if the user is currently sitting at the desk
-> find time intervals where the user is not present at the desk (trigger desk movement)
- Desk controller (via Ethernet cables, it can be connected to the desk and keypad)
- Status LEDs on the controller to show the current state (connected, not connected, showing if motion detected)

-- Study --

- Participants should be standing desk users
- Set up the controller on their workplace.
- manual movement of the desk (at least one week).
- controller usage for 1-2 weeks


-- Open questions --

Study duration?
Study design (between subjects or the same configuration for all)?
Type of motion/presence sensor using with Pi Zero?
Degree of freedom for personal configuration?
