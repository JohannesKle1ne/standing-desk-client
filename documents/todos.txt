mosquitto -v -c test.conf

sudo poweroff

________________

Learnings:
- Zugang zu Server ist nur mit key file auf PC zugänglich
- Datenbank und Server sollen auf uni Server laufen
- Broker läut auf Server und alle Tische verbinden sind dorthin
- Mein Tisch sendet nurup/down. Logik wird im keypad gemacht.


Todos:

- compare MQTT to Socket Connection (sind nachrichten verschlüsselt?)
- get motionsensor running with configuration (Distance, Accuracy)
- Think about status status LEDS 
- create Captive portal (with library)
- frontend: Look into "Dropbox like" application
 -> c# new NotifyIcon
 -> pystray could be platform independant


Learnings motionsensor:

sensitivity potentiometer: shortest distance (3 meter) when turned to 10:00 o'clock (7:00-10:00 no detection at all) -> the minimum distance of 3 meters is probalby to short!

delay potentiometer: if delay increased the sensor keeps up the detection signal a longer period. 
So the python library will find motion a lot of times after motion was detected.-> short delay seems to be more useful

Non-repeatable Trigger: After detecting motion and triggering the output high, the sensor will automatically switch to a low state after the delay time is over, 
regardless of any ongoing motion in its sensing range.

Repeatable Trigger: If there is continuous motion in the sensor's range, the output will remain high. 
The delay time will be extended automatically for each subsequent motion event, starting from the last event.


Next: Create a repository where you commit these notes and code!

Todos Donnerstag:
- find alternative motion sensor
- think about how a server monitor could look like
- build a dropbox like interface for elektron app

Findings:
- fritzbox: http://169.254.1.1/
- raspberry pi AP library: https://www.raspberryconnect.com/projects/65-raspberrypi-hotspot-accesspoints/158-raspberry-pi-auto-wifi-hotspot-switch-direct-connection
- how about putting the sonsor to the floor so only feet movement is detected?
- there is an open source version of HiveMQ that can be run on a private server
- there is a very usul "reconnectPeriod: 1000" in node mqtt
- shut down PI: sudo poweroff
- reboot PI: sudo reboot
- tutorial for PI: sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
- Wenn Iphone für Hotspot benutzen -> kompatibilität maximieren ON
- Achtung: die Ip adressen variieren natürlich wenn sich pi und client in neuen netzwerk befinden
- Die Syntax in /wpa_supplicant.conf ist wichtig (Anführungszeichen, Spaces)

TODOS morgen (03.02):
Do the following tasks from nodejs within electron:
- try to connect to PI (specific topic with response)
- if not connected try to reach pi over ssh (repeat this process)
- when connected with ssh set wifi credentials on pi -> then reboot and check mqtt again

Findings:
- Pi needs at least 2 min to startup!
- to connect to pi AP: ssh johannes@10.0.0.5
- do not try any connection attemps before pi has fully booted otherwise pi crashes
- changing the autohotspot file was leading to faild wifi connection (better don't touch it)
- added webserver.py and mqtt_client.py to rc.local to start them on boot
- on the long run creating a cron job for autohotspot will be good

TODOS morgen (04.02):
- create input fields for wifi credentails
- test AP once again by deleting current wifi credentails and sending new
- test if it works with IPhone hotsport (can be used for demo!)
- Goal: be able to present: 
1. Electron client that start from .exe and created system tray
2. Electron client connecting to broker
3. Electron client that connects to PI in AP mode
4. Electron client that sets the correct wifi credentails
5. pi in AP mode 
6. pi in Mqtt mode
- If time: create status LED for "AP mode", "Internet Connection mode" and "Mqtt mode"

Finding:
- Added cron timer to check for wifi every minute
- electron build command for windows: 
        1. Windows+X -> powershell as admin (must be run as administrator)
        2. cd C:\Users\jojok\Documents\Projects\electron-standing-desk-vuejs-vite\standing-desk-client
        3. npm run build:win
- To manually start the scripts:
sudo python /home/johannes/Documents/Code/webserver.py
sudo python /home/johannes/Documents/Code/mqtt_client.py
- Goals reached:
1. Connection process works (above poython files are called on startup, cron timer calls hotspot script every minute)
2. Without he need of ssh wifi van be configured using the electron client

TODOS Next Time:
- webserver endpoint for get wpa_supplicant
- mqtt handler for get wpa_supplicant, reboot and poweroff
- think about a good convention for mqtt topics and messages
- cleanup Vue (add tailwind, add components for buttons and spinners, use <script setup>)



TODO:
- try to get analog data from sensor
- last slide wich question that are open
- uist konference
- anmeldung? March till August
- Latex? -> Mail! jojo.kleine@gmx.de
- Server login? -> Slack (projects/desks path)
- Rainer first room on the right

Findings:
- Sensibility: range 11:00 - 16:00 -> no difference detected
- when the potentiometer "look at each other" we have a high sensibility and the signal is on for 10 seconds
- This is the correct Pin Assignment: https://pinout.xyz/pinout/pin3_gpio2/
- motion sensor is ON or OFF (not possible to get any movement specific data)
- Distance sensor:  https://draeger-it.blog/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-mit-ultraschall-abstandssensor-hc-sr04/
-> Problem: chair is like person
- Radar sensors: 
        1. HLK-LD2410: https://www.hlktech.net/index.php?id=988
                - very popular but mostly used with home assistant (does not work with batteries says this guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-GzUTyIH9c)
                - could not find Raspberry Pi tutorial, therefore could be hard to implement
                - this is a tutorial for micropython: https://github.com/shabaz123/LD2410/blob/main/ld2410.py. Could be challenging to use it with pi zero
                - maybe connect to a home assistant sensor via python on Raspberry Pi? 
        2. Seed Studio 24GHz: https://www.kaufland.de/product/469211330/?kwd&source=pla&sid=46468412&gad_source=4&gclid=CjwKCAiA_aGuBhACEiwAly57MVAB9JzQNhFAztuSpnhN_l3MX_mTDaciyq3bj8OAYaEmIdtR51h6RBoCwNcQAvD_BwE
                - similar but more expensive
                - also could not find Raspberry Pi scripts to connect

-> Looks like it can detect the presence of a person (14,50 €)
- WaveSensor: je höher die frequnenz desto langsamer der sensor. Wenn kurze frequnez -> schnells
- the mqtt user name seems not to have any effect on the connection stability


Next Meeting Luke:
- Overleaf template
- Ask about collision detection
- Figure 8 in Paper. Is it true that manual and interval were actually liked more?
- how did you handle the case when people watched a zoom meting and did not use their mouse?
- how did mouse/keyboard tracker work? What if listening to meeting? What if reading?


Findings:
- controllers seem to work the same: same code -> same led lights
-> test table up/down again


Ideas:
- before desk moves a popup apears that asks if its fine to move the desk and gives the posibblity to cancle it.
- maybe only track clicks and keyboard?


Finding:
- screen tracker not optimal, because different operating systems and privacy concerns
- mmWave worth a try
- Studie: basline + feature testing
- baseline: controller plugged in to monitor
- study: different groups with different settings
- Findings: How much often, hoch much down time? Did users like the table?
- RQ: Can be similar to Luke ones. 
- Other Idea: How must a automik des behave to suppport the user of readcihng his stanid goals?
- How can gamification with an automated standing desk support users by standing more often on their desk?
- how can an autometad standing desk nudge the user to stand more without causing frustration?
- oder
RQ: How should an autonomous standing desk be designed, to sublty assist users in reaching their desigred standing time?



Todos:
- Send id to PI aswell and save id in a userConfig file
- get id in mqttclient.py



Plan study:
- prestudy and main study?
-
