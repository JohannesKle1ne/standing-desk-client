RQ: How should an autonomous standing desk behave to encourage users to increase standing time without causing frustration?

Study:
- between-subjects (different groups of participants -> different independent variable)
- Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions
- in-the-wild study
- 1 week baseline
- 2 weeks with condition
- research through design
- pre-study questionnaire that records demographics and qualitative information about how they typically use their standing desks
- post-study    
- exit interview (when moved up, when moved down? personality of desk?)
- usage of standing desk at work as participants prerequisite

Result:
- participants appriciented when the desk movend when they were away. The they feld it was easy to accept the new position



Ideas:
- the desk goes up and down by it's own. The participant decides how long he/she wants to stand each day by setting it in the configuration.
-> theoretically no buttonpress needed

- Mode: user can define exact times for the des to move
- Mode: the user only sets daily duration. Timing is handled by the desk
- Mode: Learn from the "time to down" and "time to up" from the user to set the fitting length

- Combining motion sensor with screen tracker should cover all activieties at the desk

- Research question: How must a table be designed to create a personal connection to the user?
- Research question: how can gamification be applied to an automatic standing desk?

- what metrics could be used (quantitaitve data)?
    1. total amount of standing time (if high -> good)
    2. time to down (if high -> good)
    3. manual sit stand transitions (if low -> good)
    4. standing hours estimation (if low -> good)
    5. desk height over time (can be compared with other metrics)

- meassure "time to down"
- indepandant variables: motionsensor, motionsensor position, mousetracker, behavior learning system
- still unsure if withing subjects or repeated meassure
