“As [persona], I want to [action], so that I can [benefit].”

Connectivity:
As a user, I want to be guided through the process of setting up the controller (including adding Wi-Fi credentials), so that I know what steps to take in which order.
As a user, I want to see a status symbol for the MQTT broker connection, so that I know if I am connected or not.
As a user, I want to see a status symbol for the desk controller connection, so that I know if I am connected or not.
As a user, I want to see the current status of presence detection, to be sure the system recognizes my presence.

Statistics:
As a user, I want to see a graph that shows me the daily and weekly amount of standing time, so I can see if I am making improvements.
As a user, I want to see a comparison of average standing time per week or month, so I can see if I am making improvements.
As a user, I want to see a graph that shows me the daily and weekly amount of desk presence, so I can derive how many hours I spend working.
As a user, I want to see what percentage of working time I spend standing, to better track my progress.

Actions:
As a user, I want to use the keypad UI, so that I don't have to press the physical buttons.
As a user, I want to adjust the parameters of the presence sensor, to adapt it to my workplace.
As a user, I want to be able to set a weekly goal of standing time, to easily track my success.
As a user, I want to define preferred standing intervals throughout the day, so that I stand when I prefer to stand (morning, noon, evening).
As a user, I want the table to move down after I reach my standing goal, so that I don't have to do it manually.

Notifications:
As a user, I want to get notified when the desk wants to move up, so that I can cancel it if I don't want it to move.
As a user, I want to get notified if I am about to miss my daily standing goal, so that I can still move the table up in time.

Study:
As a study conductor, I want to see a visualization of the standing time data, to check on the actions of study participants.


Database:
- userState: height, goals, 

Events: 
prensence change: {timestamp: 12321321, present: true}
height change: {timestamp: 2324212312, height: 167}

update from controller every 30 Seconds:
{timestamp: 12321321, present: true, height: 70}
{timestamp: 34321321, present: false, height: 70}
{timestamp: 56321321, present: false, height: 150}
{timestamp: 78321321, present: true, height: 150}


At 00:00 a post requust to the server is made:
standing intervals: [{standing: false, start: 23242342, end: 512321},{standing: true, start: 512321, end: 312321}]
prensence intervals: [{standing: false, start: 23242342, end: 512321},{standing: true, start: 512321, end: 312321}]
