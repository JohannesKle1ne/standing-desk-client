As a user, I want to see the current status of presence detection, to be sure the system recognises my presence

Statistics:
As a user, I want to see a graph that shows me the daily and weekly amount of standing time, so I see if I am making imporvements
As a user, I want to see comparison of average standing time per, week or month, so I see if I am making imporvements
As a user, I want to see a graph that shows me the daily and weekly amount of desk presence, so I can derive how many hours I spend working
As a user, I want to see a what percentage of working time I spend standing, to better track my progress.


Actions:

Notifications:
- As a user, I want to get notified when the desk wants to move up, so that I can cancle it if I don't want it to move

Database:
- userState: height, goals, 

Events: 
prensence change: {timestamp: 12321321, present: true}
height change: {timestamp: 2324212312, height: 167}

update from controller every 30 Seconds:
{timestamp: 12321321, present: true, height: 70}
{timestamp: 34321321, present: false, height: 70}
{timestamp: 56321321, present: false, height: 150}
{timestamp: 78321321, present: true, height: 150}


At 00:00 a post requust to the server is made:
standing intervals: [{standing: false, start: 23242342, end: 512321},{standing: true, start: 512321, end: 312321}]
prensence intervals: [{standing: false, start: 23242342, end: 512321},{standing: true, start: 512321, end: 312321}]
